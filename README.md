In this repository, you will find the source code for the BIOE 521 final project, "Pulse at the Palm of Your Hand." This project utilizes an Adafruit Circuit Playground to create an easy-to-use and portable heart rate detector. 

#### Abstract
Measuring heart rate provides insight into gauging a person’s heart health and for measuring their physical activity during exercise. As the heart beats, it goes through the cardiac cycle where the heart muscle contracts to pump blood through the body (systole) and relaxes to refill the heart chambers with blood (diastole). If a light is shined onto the skin and measured with a photodiode, this ebb and flow of blood can be detected as an increase and decrease in reflected light. The Arduino Circuit Playground has a photodiode which is conveniently placed next by one of the NeoPixel LED lights. This combination of LED and photodiode can be utilized to detect this change in light due to the heart beating. Thus, the Arduino Circuit Playground can be used to measure and calculate the pulse of a person by placing their finger on the LED and photodiode. From this measurement, the device will then flash an LED light at the user’s heart rate – giving them their pulse at the palm of their hand. Additionally, the Arduino Circuit Playground will also allow the user to input their age to determine what percentile their heart rate is at for their age group.
